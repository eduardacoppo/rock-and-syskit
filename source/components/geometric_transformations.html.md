<div class="panel panel-default" markdown="1">
This is a page in a 3-part series. The [first
part](../libraries/geometric_transformations.html) described the problem
of handling frame and frame changes, and the best way(s) it should be handled in
library code.  This page will deal with how to integrate this concern at the
component boundary. The [third page](../component_networks/geometric_transformations.html)
explains how Syskit handles it at the system level.
