## Component/Library Separation

We **strongly recommend** that you develop most of your system's functionality
in **libraries**, instead of doing within the component framework itself. For C++, this
means creating C++ library packages that are then later integrated into Rock
components to expose that functionality to the system. For Ruby, this means
creating Ruby packages that are then used within the Ruby layers (e.g. Syskit)

**Why ?** Developing libraries is a matter of "general" software engineering
best practices. Robotics is a small field, software engineering is not. By
doing most of your work in a framework-independent manner, you ensure that you
can benefit from the much bigger ecosystem. Moreover, we haven't seen the end
of the robotic frameworks. By developing libraries that are
framework-independent, you ensure that you can integrate them elsewhere if needs
be, cutting the time and effort by **a lot**.

**How does Rock help the library/framework separation ?** Supporting this
separation during the development process is a main design driver for the
tooling. For instance, Rock's build system - `autoproj` - is not assumed to be
present by the rest of the packages. Second, `orogen` exposes C++ structures
directly into the type system. The widespread approach - using IDLs - usually
end up pushing the developers to integrate code-generated structures in their
libraries thus tying them to the framework itself.

Developing libraries is covered in the [libraries](../libraries) section.
This section deals with using library-integrated functionality and using them
to build data-processing components.

## Introduction to Components

Within Rock, components are _implemented_ in C++. They are also _specified_ in a
Ruby domain-specific language that is processed by a code generation tool,
**oroGen**. This tool ensures that the component's interface matches its
specification. It also removes most of the crude boilerplate-writing code that
is the declaration in C++ of the component interfaces.

From a package point of view, components are defined in an orogen package. The
orogen packages are all placed in the `/orogen/` subdirectory of one of the
[package categories](../workspace/conventions.html)

**Important** an oroGen package and a library can share the same basename (e.g.
`drivers/hokuyo` and `drivers/orogen/hokuyo`). This is even a recommended
behavior when an orogen package is mainly tied to a certain library.

From this page on, the rest of this section will deal with the integration of
the functionality from C++ libraries into Rock components by means of orogen.
But let's first talk about how to create an orogen package.

## Type System

One of the first thing that a system designer has to think about is defining
the data structures that will be used to exchange data between the system's
parts (in our case, between components, and between the components and Syskit).

These types are used for a few different things

* in the communication between components, and between components and Syskit
  (ports)
* in the configuration of the component (properties)
* to assess the component's state, i.e. diagnotics and monitoring (ports)
* to provide information about the component's internal state, i.e. debugging (ports)

In Rock, the types are defined in C++, ideally within the libraries but
sometimes within the component packages. They are then exported into Rock's
type system to allow for their **transport** (communication between
processes), but also for their manipulation in Syskit.

This section will detail [how types are defined](defining_types.html), how
they can [be used within oroGen packages](importing_types.html), and how
they are [mapped into the Ruby layers](types_in_ruby.html) to ease their use
on the tooling side.

## Development Workflow

Developing a component involves doing mainly three things:

- [defining and importing data types](importing_types.html) for usage on
  its interface. The recommended course of action for functionality developed
  targetting Rock is to make sure that the library package defines C++ types
  [compatible with Rock's type system](../components/defining_types.html), and
  import these types directly. Alternatively, you may define types within the
  oroGen package and do the conversion between the library and the Rock
  type system, either manually or automatically using [opaque types](../components/importing_types.html#opaques)
- defining the component(s) interface(s) in the orogen file
- implementing the processing parts of the component in C++

**Let's remember** we strongly recommend that you develop the bulk of your
component's functionality in **libraries**, instead of doing in the components
themselves.
{: .important}

Each time data types or the orogen specification are modified, one must run
orogen to re-generate code. After code generation, the package behaves like
a CMake package.

The best way to build an oroGen package is to use
[`amake`](../basics/day_to_day.html). It takes care of code generation and
building the generated CMake package.

## Runtime Workflow

"Developing" a component in C++ within Rock is to write a C++ class that
interacts with its inputs/outputs. This class does not specify when the
processing is going to be called, and under which OS resource (threads,
processes). It is said that the _component implementation_ is separated
from the _system deployment_. The first one is really writing the C++ code that
interacts with the component's interface. The second one is part of system
integration.

What it means in practice is that a component implement is nothing more than a standalone
C++ class. This C++ class can be instantiated multiple times in a single
system, using different periods or triggering mechanisms, different threading
policies, â€¦

When you define components in oroGen, you create a _task library_, which is a
shared library in which the task context classes are defined. Then, you need to
put these libraries in _deployments_ (which is also done by oroGen). Finally,
you can start these deployments, connect the tasks together, and monitor them
using Syskit.
