# Designing Reusable Networks
{:.no_toc}

- TOC
{:toc}

So far, in this chapter as well as in the [Basics](../basics), we have designed
fairly specific networks - all the components they use are fully specified. The
only thing that was not a proper component was the device in the [Basics
section](../basics/devices.html).

This is very constraining. The networks and profile we built in the Basics
chapter could for instance not been adapted to a system where the arm control
is not a single device, but a whole sub-network. Generally speaking, it is not enough.

The first tool we will introduce in this section, that allows for more general
networks, is the **data service**. Data services are placeholders for real
components, a type system of sorts, that can be replaced in profiles by actual
component implementations.

Other mechanisms are then built on top of the data services. Profiles can
inherit from each other, gradually replacing data services or sub-networks by
more specific ones. Compositions can also be subclassed to refine their
children in the same way.  The core mechanism that make this possible is
_dependency injection_, that is the ability to transform a network into another
by replacing sub-parts of the network.  This what the `use` statement we
[saw](profiles.html#dependency_injection) in
[passing](../basics/devices.html#profile_define)

## Data Services Definition {#data_services}

Defining a data service entails giving it a name, which represents what the
data service represents, and providing it with a dataflow interface (input and
output ports).

Data services are defined using a `data_service_type` statement in a class or module
context. The data service name must be in `CamelCase`, and the new data service
is registered on the enclosing module, e.g.

~~~ ruby
module CommonModels
  module Services
    data_service_type 'GlobalPosition' do
      output_port 'position_samples', '/base/samples/RigidBodyState'
    end
  end
end
~~~

The types used in the data service must be imported first by adding the
relevant [`import_types_from` statement at toplevel](../components/types_in_ruby.html#import_types_from)
{: .important}

__Naming Convention__ data services are by convention defined in the `AppName::Services`
module, and are saved in `models/services/name_of_service.rb`. For instance,
the `Pose` data service in the `CommonModels` bundle is saved in
`models/services/global_position.rb` and the full service name would be
`CommonModels::Services::GlobalPosition`.

__Generation__ A template for a new data service, following Syskit's naming
conventions and file system structure, can be generated with

~~~
syskit gen srv name_of_service
~~~

for instance

~~~
syskit gen srv global_position
~~~

If needed, service models can be defined in namespaces, with e.g.

~~~
syskit gen srv control/joints
~~~

which defines the service as `Services::Control::Joints`

Data services do not have tests.

## Data Service Providers

Components and compositions **provide** data services. That is, they offer to
the system the port interface, and pledge to offer the service's role in the
system through that interface.

For instance, a camera obviously provides an image service. Most cameras,
however, would not provide a depth image service. Even if both use the same
data type for data representation, the data service system allows to make the
difference.

Another example, `common_models` `JointsControlledSystem` service. This
represents a set of joints that can be controlled **in addition to** a feedback
stream. In case the motor driver implementation requires one component per
motor, one would export a whole arm using multiplexer/demultiplexer and a
composition. The composition would then provide the `JointsControlledSystem`
service.

In its simplest form, the `provide` statement with the service model and a
service name can be added to the component or composition. The name has to be
unique in the context of the component.

Let's assume a `gps::Task` component which has the following interface definition:

~~~ ruby
task_context 'Task' do
  output_port 'position_samples', '/base/samples/RigidBodyState'
end
~~~

One can declare that this component provides the `GlobalPosition` data service from `common_models` with:

~~~ ruby
Syskit.extend_model OroGen.gps.Task do
  provides CommonModels::Services::GlobalPosition,
    as: 'position'
end
~~~

To be able to call `provide` like this, each of the data services ports must
have a **single port** on the component (exported port in the case of
compositions) that matches the port direction and type. In case
there is more than one match, the ports must be matched explicitly by passing a
mapping from the service's position name to the component's. If our gps
component had an interface like:

~~~ ruby
task_context 'Task' do
  # Position in the local frame
  output_port 'local_position_samples',
    '/base/samples/RigidBodyState'
  # Position in the UTM frame
  output_port 'utm_position_samples',
    '/base/samples/RigidBodyState'
end
~~~

Then attempting to provide the service without mapping information would cause the following error:

~~~
OroGen.gps.Task does not provide the 'CommonModels::Services::GlobalPosition' service's interface
 there are multiple candidates to map position_samples[/base/samples/RigidBodyState]: local_position_samples, utm_position_samples
~~~

The mapping must be provided explicitly:
{: #multiple_data_services}

~~~ ruby
Syskit.extend_model OroGen.gps.Task do
  provides CommonModels::Services::Position, as: 'local_position',
    'position_samples' => 'local_position_samples'
  provides CommonModels::Services::GlobalPosition, as: 'utm_position',
    'position_samples' => 'utm_position_samples'
end
~~~

**Data services and component subclassing** The data service system
allows to exchange components that are unrelated code-wise but have a
relationship from a semantic point of view. This is the preferred way.
Subclass two orogen components only if they share a significant amount of
code.
{: .important}

## Relationships between Data Services {#data_service_relationships}

Data types sometimes are semantically complex, that is combine more than one
data into a single sample. The canonical example is a pose, which provides both
a position and an orientation. However, there are other systems that may provide
only an orientation or only a pose. Within Rock, in order to allow a pose
output to be connected to an orientation input, one must use the same data
type. This means that the type (in our pose example,
`/base/samples/RigidBodyState`) can represent a complex data (the full pose) as
well as its parts (position and orientation).

These relationships can be represented within the data service system. The
relationships between the data services are modelled by declaring that
a service `provides` another. In this case, no name has to be provided
since there is no ambiguity - a service cannot provide the same other service
multiple times.

Unlike with components, `provides` in this case does not attempt to map the
provided service ports to the provider's. It will instead, by default, **add**
the provided service ports to the provider interface. Port mappings are instead
required to avoid the port creation.

For instance, if one would define the `GlobalPosition`, `Position`, `Orientation` and `Pose` services like this:

~~~ ruby
data_service_type 'Position' do
  output_port 'position_samples', '/base/samples/RigidBodyState'
end
data_service_type 'GlobalPosition' do
  provides Position
end
data_service_type 'Orientation' do
  output_port 'orientation_samples', '/base/samples/RigidBodyState'
end
data_service_type 'Pose' do
  output_port 'pose_samples', '/base/samples/RigidBodyState'
  provides Position
  provides Orientation
end
~~~

The resulting data service would be this:

![Pose service without port mappings](media/pose_service_without_port_mappings.svg){: .fullwidth}

By explicitly mapping the provided service ports with:

~~~ ruby
data_service_type 'Pose' do
  output_port 'pose_samples', '/base/samples/RigidBodyState'
  provides Position, 'position_samples' => 'pose_samples'
  provides Orientation, 'orientation_samples' => 'pose_samples'
end
~~~

One gets the expected:

![Pose service with port mappings](media/pose_service_with_port_mappings.svg){: .fullwidth}

**Note** the Syskit IDE shows the list of provided services, along with the port mappings for them.
{: .note}

## Using Data Services as Children in Compositions

Data services can be used as-is in compositions. In fact, the device model [we
have used in the basics chapter](../basics/composition.html) is at its core a
data service.  The joint control composition
[from the Basics](../basics/composition.html) should be rewritten using a data service.
This requires to replace the device model by the data service, but also to change the
port names (obviously)
{: #armcartesiancontrol_with_data_service}

~~~ ruby
# The _control_loop files define a set of data services related to
# controlling using the /base/samples/Joints data type
require 'common_models/models/services/joints_control_loop'
# Load the oroGen projects
using_task_library 'cart_ctrl_wdls'
using_task_library 'robot_frames'

module SyskitBasics
  module Compositions
    class ArmCartesianControlWdls < Syskit::Composition
      add OroGen.cart_ctrl_wdls.WDLSSolver, as: 'twist2joint_velocity'
      add OroGen.cart_ctrl_wdls.CartCtrl, as: 'position2twist'
      # This was a device
      add CommonModels::Services::JointsControlledSystem, as: 'arm'
      add OroGen.robot_frames.SingleChainPublisher, as: 'joint2pose'

      position2twist_child.ctrl_out_port.
        connect_to twist2joint_velocity_child.desired_twist_port
      # Needed to update the ports
      twist2joint_velocity_child.solver_output_port.
        connect_to arm_child.command_in_port
      arm_child.status_out_port.
        connect_to twist2joint_velocity_child.joint_status_port
      arm_child.status_out_port.
        connect_to joint2pose_child.joints_samples_port
      joint2pose_child.tip_pose_port.
        connect_to position2twist_child.cartesian_status_port

      export position2twist_child.command_port
    end
  end
end
~~~

**Devices vs. data services ?** Generally speaking, one seldom use a device in
a composition. Do you really need a Garmin GPS in a particular network ? Can't
it work with any other receiver ? Or even a complete network that does pose
estimation instead of a GPS ? Using devices in compositions breaks generality
with zero advantage, since one still has to do things at the profile level to
use the composition.
{: .note}

A data service child within a composition can be refined in subclasses by using
the `overload` statement. A data service child can be overloaded by either
another data service that provides it, or a component that does. If one still
*really* wanted to use the device model in a joint control composition, he could with

~~~ ruby
class GazeboCartesianControlWdls < ArmCartesianControlWdls
  overload arm_child, CommonModels::Devices::Gazebo::Model
end
~~~

## Dependency Injection {#injection}

Data services are obviously abstract in nature. One cannot run a network that
contains a data service, we therefore need a mechanism to transform composition
models to replace services by concrete components. While overloading
compositions would be a possibility, it would lead to having dense forest of
composition models, as one would need to define a single composition model for
each assignation of concrete components to the services.

Syskit has another mechanism for this, the `use` statement we already
discussed.  When `.use('child_name' => NewModel, …)` is called on a composition
model, the result is the composition model with the given child replaced by the
new model. If a child is itself a composition, a grandchild can be selected by
separating the names with dots (e.g. `.use('child.grandchild' => NewModel)`).

The composition overload we did just above could equivalent have been using a
`use` statement:

~~~ ruby
ArmCartesianControlWdls.use('arm' => CommonModels::Devices::Gazebo::Model)
~~~

Syskit validates type compatibility, of course, that is the replacement is
valid only if it is another service that provides the child's or a component
that does. If the types are incompatible, one gets the following message:

~~~
invalid selection for arm
got OroGen.cart_ctrl_wdls.CartCtrl
which provides
  OroGen.cart_ctrl_wdls.CartCtrl
  OroGen.RTT.TaskContext
  Syskit::TaskContext
  Syskit::Component
  Roby::Task
expected something that provides child arm of type CommonModels::Services::JointsControlledSystem
~~~

If multiple services match the requested service type, one can select one
explicitly by passing the service instead of the component. A component model
can be accessed with the `${service_name}_srv` accessor. In our [fake GPS
task](#multiple_data_services), one would access the UTM position service with
`OroGen.gps.Task.utm_position_srv` and the local position service with
`OroGen.gps.Task.local_position_srv`.

The result of the `use` statements can be used anywhere a component or service
can be used, as for instance as a composition child or profile definition. It
can be chained with other model modifiers such as `with_arguments` or
`with_conf`. This is how we injected [the robot device in out control
compositions](../basics/devices.html):

~~~ ruby
profile 'ArmControl' do
  define 'arm_cartesian_constant_control',
    Compositions::ArmCartesianConstantControlWdls.
      use(Base.ur10_dev)
  define 'arm_joint_position_constant_control',
  	Compositions::JointPositionConstantControl.
  	  use(Base.ur10_dev)
  define 'arm_safe_position',
  	arm_joint_position_constant_control_def.
  	  with_arguments(setpoint: UR10_SAFE_POSITION)
end
~~~


## Managing Reusability in Profiles

Profiles are the objects that expose the "final" networks, that is the networks
that are going to be used at runtime. As such, they usually are the place where
the replacement of services by actual concrete components happen, rather by doing
it with subclassing of compositions.

**Composition overload vs. injection in profiles** As the saying goes, there
are only two hard things in computer science: caching invalidation and naming
things. Doing the data service replacements using dependency injection avoid
polluting the composition namespaces with all the possible combinations of
services. Use subclassing when the subclass need changes related to
coordination. Stick to profiles in all other cases.
{: .important}

In complex systems, one often ends up with two or three layers of profiles, to share
the definitions between the simulated and real systems. The two layer structure
is:

1. Root layer, defines networks that are still generic, but are already tuned
   to the needs of your application
2. Configuration-specific layer, where the networks are ready to run.

The third layer (actually, layer 0) exists when one creates a domain-specific
bundle, that is defines networks that are meant to be used widely by whole
communities (i.e. manipulation, …). In this case, Layer 1 would refine these
networks and add new ones that are specific to your application.

When used in profiles, one does not see which data services a composition has.
In complex systems, relying on the knowledge of which data services need to be
replaced is borderline impossible. In order to keep this manageable, profiles
define _tags_. Tags are profile-level services that represent a so-called
_inflexion point_, that is a point that is available for adaptation of the
profile. These tags can then be injected in the definitions to "replace" the
composition's data services. A tag is defined with

~~~ ruby
tag 'tag_name', Services::Model
~~~

and are then accessed with the `${tag_name}_tag` pattern. For instance, the arm
control based on data services [we just defined](#armcartesiancontrol_with_data_service)
would be integrated in a Root profile with:

~~~ ruby
module SyskitBasics
  module Profiles
    profile 'ArmControl' do
      tag 'arm', CommonModels::Services::JointsControlledSystem

      define 'arm_cartesian_constant_control',
        Compositions::ArmCartesianConstantControlWdls.
          use(arm_tag)
      define 'arm_joint_position_constant_control',
        Compositions::JointPositionConstantControl.
          use(arm_tag)
      define 'arm_safe_position',
        arm_joint_position_constant_control_def
    end
  end
end
~~~

**Note** that we removed the default joint position in the `arm_safe_position`
definition, which is obviously UR10-specific
{: .note}

A root profile is then imported within the configuration-specific layer with
the `use_profile` statement. Tags are replaced by providing the `"tag_name"
=> tag_replacement` syntax. Our UR10 profile would be defined with:

~~~ ruby
module SyskitBasics
  module Profiles
    module Gazebo
      profile 'ArmControl' do
        use_profile Profiles::ArmControl,
          'arm' => Base.ur10_dev
      end
    end
  end
end
~~~

If further refinement, such as default arguments, are necessary, they are using
the `define` syntax, but then use the `_def` accessor directly:

~~~ ruby
module SyskitBasics
  module Profiles
    module Gazebo
      profile 'ArmControl' do
        use_profile Profiles::ArmControl,
          'arm' => Base.ur10_dev
        define 'arm_safe_position', arm_safe_position_def.
          with_arguments(setpoint: UR10_SAFE_POSITION)
      end
    end
  end
end
~~~

**Naming scheme and file structure** root ("generic") profiles are defined
within the root `${appname}::Profiles` namespace, and saved within `models/profiles/`.
Configuration-specific profiles are saved within
`${appname}::Profiles::${ConfigurationName}` (e.g. `Profiles::Gazebo`) and saved within
`models/profiles/configuration_name/` (e.g. `models/profiles/gazebo`). Use the
`-r` option of `syskit gen profile` can be used to create the new profile under
the right folder, e.g. `syskit gen profile -rgazebo arm_control`
{: .note}

**Profile properties** a profile can be _self-contained_, _ready to
instanciate_ and _ready to deploy_ (and it is **broken** if it is none of
these).

A **self contained profiles** is a profile where the only abstract parts are
tags defined within itself. The default tests for profiles contain the `it {
is_self_contained }` lines which verifies this property. Being self-contained
ensures that, when reusing the profile, the only thing the developer needs to
know are this profile's tags, which can be easily read and documented. As the
generated test file says: "You usually want this. Really. Keep it there.". This
is the only test you usually will want in layer 0 and 1 profiles.

A **ready-to-instanciate profile** is a profile that has no abstract parts.
This is what you want in the layer 2 profiles and is tested with `it {
can_instanciate }`. It obviously implies that the profile is self-contained.
But as the generated tests say, keep both. This ensures that if you remove
the `can_instanciate` test, you'll still be testing that the profile is
self-contained.

A **ready-to-deployed profile** is a profile that has no abstract parts and for
which all components are assigned a proper deployment. This is usually what
you want in the layer 2 profiles and is tested with `it { can_deploy }`. It
obviously implies that the profile is self-contained and can be instantiated.
But as the generated tests say, keep all three. This ensures that if you remove the
`can_deploy` test, you'll still be testing for the two other properties.

## Deployments {#deployments}

During the basics, we've seen that one must define
[deployments](../basics/deployment.html#use_deployment) to be able to run the
network. We also discussed have seen in more details how deployments are
created [within oroGen projects](../components/deployment.html).

Defining deployments within a robot's configuration `requires` block is often
the only thing you need to do. The only case where you will need more is when
more than one deployment exists of a certain component. In this case, you will
need to create [multiple deployments of the same task
model](../components/runtime.html), and Syskit will
require you to specify which deployment the networks should use with the
`prefer_deployed_tasks` specification. The specification either takes a string
- in which case it must match the deployment name exactly - or a regular
expression. The preferred patterns are inherited in the hierarchy, so the
specification can be given at the composition level to be applied to the
components. With a systematic use of patterns in deployment names, one can use
regular expressions to disambiguate whole networks. Strings are used to match
the names exactly

For instance, the left and right camera deployments of a stereo processing
composition could be selected with:

~~~ ruby
profile 'Perception' do
  define 'stereo_depth_processing', Compositions::StereoDepthProcessing.
    use('left_camera' => Camera.prefer_deployed_tasks('left_camera'),
        'right_camera' => Camera.prefer_deployed_tasks('right_camera'))
end
~~~

But if one needs whole processing chains for both cameras, one could decide
that all deployments related to the left camera are prefixed with `left_` and
all deployments related to the right camera are prefixed with `right_`. Regular
expressions will then help:

~~~ ruby
profile 'Perception' do
  define 'left_preprocessed_camera', Compositions::CameraPreprocessing.
    prefer_deployed_tasks(/^left_/)
  define 'right_preprocessed_camera', Compositions::CameraPreprocessing.
    prefer_deployed_tasks(/^right_/)
end
~~~

The last example would be to select a deployed tasks pattern on a whole
profile. The Profile API does not allow to do this directly, but it can
easily be done with:

~~~ ruby
profile 'LeftArmControl' do
  use_profile Profiles::ArmControl,
    'arm' => Base.left_arm_dev

  each_definition do |definition|
    define definition.name, definition.
      prefer_deployed_tasks(/^left_/)
  end
end
~~~

and

~~~ ruby
profile 'RightArmControl' do
  use_profile ArmControl,
    'arm' => Base.right_arm_dev

  each_definition do |definition|
    define definition.name, definition.
      prefer_deployed_tasks(/^right_/)
  end
end
~~~

**Note** the two profiles share the same definition names, which means that
they cannot be directly used at the same time [in the action
interface](../basics/deployment.html#actions). It is possible to transform the definition
names within the `use_profile` statement with the `transform_names` option:

~~~ ruby
profile 'RightArmControl' do
  use_profile ArmControl,
    'arm' => Base.left_arm_dev,
    transform_names: ->(base_name) { "left_#{base_name}" }
end
~~~

## A Word of Warning

The Syskit type system is _rich_. It has a tendency to play with the software
engineer aspiration of making everything general and reusable.

So **be careful with this**. A Syskit model set that is all-general will be
also all-unmanageable. In most cases, make _resonably large_ compositions that
contain few data services. Don't reuse compositions just because the other
composition existed. Reuse compositions because there is either a semantic link
between the two, or because there is a practical reason to. There is no clear
rule to follow, so it is something that you have to keep in mind so that you
keep it under control.

Syskit acts as a type and test system. Its aim is to make refactoring as easy
as it can be. Don't over-think your designs in advance. Rather, be too specific
and refactor as necessary.
